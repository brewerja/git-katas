# Git Kata: Pushing to a Remote
In this kata you will share your changes with a remote repository.

In this scenario, you've cloned a repository.

You'll begin by making some changes locally.

## Setup:

1. Run `. setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## The task

1. Make some changes to foo.txt and commit them. Remember to always do your work in a branch!
1. Merge your changes into master.
1. Push your changes to the `origin` remote.
1. What happened?
1. Figure out how to incorporate changes from the remote before pushing again.

## Useful commands
 - `git checkout -b feature`
 - `git push`
 - `git fetch`
 - `git pull`
 - `git pull --rebase`
